                        <p>The Robo-Tech Forum proudly participated in DD ROBOCON 2022, a prestigious national-level
                            robotics competition hosted by India at Thyagaraj Stadium, New Delhi. The theme for the
                            event was “Lagori,” inspired by the traditional Indian game, where teams were challenged to
                            build robots capable of executing the game's tasks with precision and coordination. Our team
                            was led by Mr. Nikesh Mankar, with Mr. Aniket Yenpreddiwar as the Electronics Head, Mr. Amit
                            Kendre as the Mechanical Head, and Mr. Gaurav Vishrojawar as the Team Coordinator. The team
                            worked under the expert guidance of our respected faculty coordinator, Dr. R. B. Sharma. In
                            the first stage, which involved submitting a detailed design document, the team demonstrated
                            exceptional innovation and clarity, securing a perfect score of 100 out of 100. Moving into
                            the second stage, which required a video demonstration and system execution, the team
                            continued its strong performance by scoring 98 out of 100. With an outstanding aggregate of
                            99 out of 100, the team successfully qualified for the final national stage of the
                            competition. In the grand finale, amidst intense competition from top institutions across
                            the country, the team secured an impressive All India Rank of 31. Through this journey, the
                            team explored and implemented various aspects of robotics, including mechanical design,
                            sensor integration and control systems. The experience not only deepened their technical
                            knowledge but also taught them valuable lessons in teamwork, real-time problem solving, and
                            system-level engineering. Participation in DD ROBOCON 2022 marked a major milestone for The
                            Robo-Tech Forum, motivating every member to push the boundaries of innovation and setting a
                            strong foundation for future endeavors in the field of robotics.</p>

                        <h4>AERO</h4>

                        <p>In RTF, we have a completely separate domain for Aero and Aviation Technology. Members who
                            are more enthusiastic about flying machines like RC Planes, drones, etc., are given a set of
                            components and resources that suit them best to achieve their goals and create something
                            they are truly passionate about. The Aero branch in RTF excels in every field, whether it be
                            competitions, expos, or sessions organized by RTF. During introductory sessions for new RTF
                            recruits, they are shown every plane and drone built in RTF to capture their interest in
                            this field.</p>

                        <h4>RC Planes</h4>

                        <p>RC Planes are primarily used for small-scale testing before the actual manufacturing of real
                            planes. A wide variety of RC Planes are built in RTF, including:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Transall C-160</strong>
                                <p>An RC model of the Transall C-160 was built with motors providing sufficient thrust
                                    along with ESCs capable of handling the amperage draw. The wingspan and fuselage
                                    dimensions were scaled proportionally to maintain stability during flight.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Delta Wing</strong>
                                <p>Delta-wing RC planes are known for their triangular wing shape, offering excellent
                                    stability at high speeds and maneuverability. This plane typically used lightweight
                                    materials for construction and required a high-speed BLDC motor with propellers
                                    optimized for aerodynamic efficiency. The wing area was carefully calculated to
                                    ensure lift and stability during flight.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Tail-Sitter VTOL</strong>
                                <p>A Tail-Sitter Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft was designed to take off
                                    and land vertically while maintaining a horizontal flight position. This innovative
                                    design allowed for compact storage and operation in limited spaces. The tail-sitter
                                    featured unique propulsion systems that enabled a smooth transition between vertical
                                    and horizontal flight.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>P-40</strong>
                                <p>The P-40 Warhawk was a classic WWII fighter plane known for its ruggedness and
                                    versatility. In RC form, it retained the iconic shark-mouth design and featured a
                                    wingspan of approximately 1.2m (47 in). The model was typically powered by an
                                    electric motor, providing speeds up to 80 km/h (50 mph). With its semi-symmetrical
                                    airfoil, the P-40 offered stable flight characteristics suitable for both novice and
                                    experienced pilots.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>FT-Old Foggy</strong>
                                <p>The FT-Old Foggy was a popular RC trainer aircraft designed for beginners. It
                                    featured a high-wing configuration that enhanced stability during flight. With a
                                    wingspan of about 1.2m (48 in), this model was lightweight and easy to handle.
                                    Typically powered by an electric motor, the FT-Old Foggy was known for its slow
                                    flight capabilities, making it ideal for learning basic flying skills without the
                                    risk of rapid descent or stalling.</p>

                        <h4>Drones</h4>

                        <p>Drones are an integral part of not only RTF but also the modern world. They have a wide range
                            of applications across various industries. At RTF, we continuously strive to build better
                            drones, improve upon existing models, and provide hands-on experience to new recruits.
                            Currently, there are three types of drones present in RTF:</p>

                        <ul text-align:>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Tricopter</strong>
                                <p>The Tricopter is a three-rotor drone featuring a yaw mechanism controlled by a servo
                                    on the rear motor. It uses an FSI-6 flight controller with ESCs regulating the
                                    brushless motors. The frame is made from lightweight materials, providing excellent
                                    stability and maneuverability.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>F-450 (Quadcopter)</strong>
                                <p>The F-450 Quadcopter is built with four brushless motors and 30A ESCs. An FSI-6
                                    flight controller manages stabilization, making it a reliable platform for aerial
                                    photography or general flying. A LiPo battery powers the system, offering decent
                                    flight endurance.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Hexacopter</strong>
                                <p>The Hexacopter is a six-rotor drone featuring a yaw mechanism controlled by a servo
                                    on the rear motor. It uses an FSI-6 flight controller with ESCs regulating the
                                    brushless motors. The frame is made from lightweight materials, providing excellent
                                    stability and maneuverability.</p>
